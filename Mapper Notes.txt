- Moved the gym maps and a few others to "Unused Warps".

Bugs:
- One Island Pokemon Center is not randomized.  If you want to go into that quagmire, that's your own problem.

To Fix:
-Check that we don't require navigation of sky pillar exterior.
-Circles!

-Weight the RNG by open warps so that we don't end up with all the warps in the biggest hubs facing each other. (Maybe don't fix?)



-We're done!
