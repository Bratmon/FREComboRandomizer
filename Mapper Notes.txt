- Moved the gym maps and a few others to "Unused Warps".

Bugs:
- One Island Pokemon Center is not randomized.  If you want to go into that quagmire, that's your own problem.

To Fix:
-Make the Emerald hallways all one-way.
-Create a category of "Rooms we can get dragged into" and make sure they don't end up behind requirement doors.
-Check that we don't require navigation of sky pillar exterior.

-Weight the RNG by open warps so that we don't end up with all the warps in the biggest hubs facing each other. (Maybe don't fix?)



-We're done!
