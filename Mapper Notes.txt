- Moved the gym maps and a few others to "Unused Warps".

Bugs:
- One Island Pokemon Center is not randomized.  If you want to go into that quagmire, that's your own problem.

To Fix:
-Fix walking into Elite 4 rooms in Fire Red; sometimes it works and shouldn't sometimes it doesn't work and should.
-Teleport from anywhere works but fly doesn't (See Task_Flymap) (Only in FR)
-Weight the RNG by open warps so that we don't end up with all the warps in the biggest hubs facing each other. (Maybe don't fix?)

-We're done!
